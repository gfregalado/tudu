# Go Pet Project

## Overview
This project is a personal pet project aimed at exploring and understanding various technologies including Go (Golang), PostgreSQL, HTMX, Templ, and Tailwind CSS. It's designed as a learning tool to get hands-on experience with these technologies and their integration.

## Technologies
- **Go (Golang):** A statically typed, compiled programming language designed at Google.
- **PostgreSQL:** An open-source relational database management system.
- **HTMX:** A modern way to enhance your websites using AJAX, CSS Transitions, WebSockets, and Server Sent Events.
- **Templ:** A templating engine for Go, simplifying HTML generation.
- **Tailwind CSS:** A utility-first CSS framework for rapid UI development.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Make sure you have Go installed on your system. [Download Go](https://golang.org/dl/)
- PostgreSQL should be set up and running. [Get PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/download/)
- Node.js is required for Tailwind CSS. [Install Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)
- Templ requires Go. Ensure it's installed as part of the setup.

### Setup
Clone the repository to your local machine:
```bash
git clone [URL of your repository]
cd [repository name]
```

### Usage
The Makefile includes several commands to facilitate building and running the project:

### Run:
Executes the Tailwind CSS process, Templ generation, and then runs the Go application.
```bash
make run
```
